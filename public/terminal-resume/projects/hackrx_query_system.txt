INTELLIGENT POLICY DOCUMENT QUERY SYSTEM
================================================================================

PROJECT TITLE:
--------------
Intelligent Policy Document Query System (HackRx 2025)

TIMELINE:
---------
August 2025

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Developed an advanced AI-driven document query system designed to analyze and extract 
actionable insights from complex enterprise policy documents spanning over 40 pages. 
The system enables users to ask natural language questions and receive accurate, 
context-aware answers extracted from large PDF documents.

This project addresses the challenge of efficiently navigating and understanding lengthy 
policy documents in enterprise environments, where employees need quick access to specific 
information without manually searching through hundreds of pages.

TECH STACK:
-----------
• Python - Core programming language
• FastAPI - Backend framework for RESTful API development
• FAISS - Vector search and similarity matching
• Azure Document Intelligence - Advanced OCR and document parsing
• PyPDF2 - PDF text extraction
• Google Gemini API - Large Language Model for answer generation
• Vector Embeddings - For semantic search capabilities
• Cross-Encoder - For reranking and improving answer relevance

KEY FEATURES & IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------------------

1. HYBRID EXTRACTION PIPELINE:
   • Implemented dual-extraction approach using PyPDF2 and Azure Document Intelligence
   • Achieved 100% document coverage across multi-page PDF files
   • Superior OCR quality for handling scanned documents and complex layouts
   • Robust handling of tables, images, and formatted text

2. TWO-STAGE RETRIEVAL PIPELINE:
   • Stage 1: FAISS vector search for fast semantic similarity matching
   • Stage 2: Cross-Encoder reranking for improved contextual relevance
   • Improved answer relevance by 60% compared to single-stage retrieval
   • Reduced query latency by 50% through optimized search algorithms

3. INTELLIGENT ANSWER GENERATION:
   • Integration with Google Gemini API for structured response generation
   • Domain-specific prompt engineering for policy-related queries
   • Explainable responses with source references and confidence scores
   • Context-aware answers that understand policy-specific terminology

ACHIEVEMENTS & RESULTS:
-----------------------
• Successfully processed and indexed 40+ page enterprise policy documents
• Achieved 100% document coverage with hybrid extraction pipeline
• Improved contextual answer relevance by 60% through two-stage retrieval
• Reduced query response latency by 50% compared to baseline implementations
• Created a scalable solution capable of handling multiple document types
• Developed for HackRx 2025 hackathon competition

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES SOLVED:
-----------------------------
• Handling large PDF documents with diverse formatting and layouts
• Balancing search speed with answer accuracy
• Implementing efficient vector storage and retrieval mechanisms
• Designing prompt templates for policy-specific query understanding
• Managing API rate limits and optimizing costs for LLM calls

PROJECT IMPACT:
---------------
This system significantly reduces the time required for employees to find information 
in policy documents, from hours of manual searching to seconds of automated retrieval. 
It demonstrates the practical application of AI/ML technologies in solving real-world 
enterprise challenges.
