PROJECT: HEALTHCARE AI AUDITOR
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
------------------
Develop an AI-powered system to automatically compare user-submitted Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) with government healthcare guidelines to ensure
compliance and identify discrepancies.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Healthcare facilities must adhere to strict government guidelines and regulations.
Manual auditing of SOPs is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. An automated
system can ensure compliance, reduce audit time, and improve patient safety.

SOLUTION DEVELOPED:
-------------------
Built an intelligent AI auditor that:
• Accepts user SOP documents (PDF/text format)
• Retrieves relevant government guidelines
• Compares documents using NLP and AI
• Identifies compliance gaps and discrepancies
• Generates detailed audit report with recommendations
• Highlights specific areas requiring attention

================================================================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. Document Processing:
   • PDF/text file upload and parsing
   • Text extraction and preprocessing

   • LLM (likely Gemini API or similar) for intelligent comparison
   • Similarity scoring between SOP and guidelines
   • Gap identification algorithm

4. Report Generation:
   • Automated report creation
   • Highlighting non-compliant sections
   • Recommendations for corrections
   • Severity classification (critical, moderate, minor)

5. User Interface:
   • Simple upload interface
   • Progress indication during processing
   • Clear result visualization
   • Downloadable audit report

TECH STACK (Likely Used):
• Python - Core implementation
