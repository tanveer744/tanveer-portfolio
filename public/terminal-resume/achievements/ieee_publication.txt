ABSTRACT / OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This research paper presents a novel approach to detecting road rage and aggressive
driving behavior using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system
employs a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture specifically designed
to analyze video sequences and identify patterns indicative of dangerous driving
behaviors.

The study addresses the growing concern of road safety by providing an automated
solution for detecting aggressive driving incidents before they escalate into
serious accidents. This research contributes to the field of intelligent
transportation systems and traffic safety management.
