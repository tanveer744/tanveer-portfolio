METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

The IBM Data Science Methodology follows a cyclical approach:

1. FROM PROBLEM TO APPROACH:
   • Business Understanding → Analytic Approach

2. WORKING WITH DATA:
   • Data Requirements → Data Collection → Data Understanding → Data Preparation

3. DERIVING THE ANSWER:
   • Modeling → Evaluation

4. FEEDBACK:
   • Deployment → Feedback → (back to Business Understanding)

This iterative framework ensures systematic and effective data science projects.
