TOOLS & PLATFORMS
================================================================================

This document covers the essential development tools, platforms, and utilities
used for software development, version control, collaboration, and productivity.

================================================================================
VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
================================================================================

GIT (Advanced):
---------------
Git is the distributed version control system used for tracking code changes and
collaboration.

CORE COMMANDS & WORKFLOWS:
• Repository Management:
  - git init - Initialize new repository
  - git clone - Clone remote repository
  - git remote - Manage remote repositories
  - git fetch/pull - Retrieve updates from remote

• Basic Operations:
  - git add - Stage changes for commit
  - git commit - Save changes with message
  - git push - Upload changes to remote
  - git status - Check working directory status
  - git log - View commit history

• Branching & Merging:
  - git branch - Create and list branches
  - git checkout / git switch - Switch between branches
  - git merge - Integrate changes from different branches
  - git rebase - Reapply commits on top of another base
  - git cherry-pick - Apply specific commits

• Advanced Features:
  - git stash - Temporarily save uncommitted changes
  - git reset - Undo commits and changes
  - git revert - Create new commit that undoes changes
  - git diff - Compare changes between commits/branches

  - Feature branches for new development
  - Pull requests for code review
  - Merging after approval

• Gitflow:
  - Main and develop branches
  - Feature, release, and hotfix branches
  - Structured release management

BEST PRACTICES:
• Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
• Commit message conventions (Conventional Commits)
• Regular commits to track incremental progress
• Branch naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
• Keeping branches up-to-date with main branch
• Resolving conflicts carefully
• Never committing sensitive data (use .gitignore)
